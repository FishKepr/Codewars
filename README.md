index.html is simply a template for calling solution.js and displaying the results in the console log.

Solution.js contains a single function:
<ul>
<li>This function accepts two arrays, one with the 'correct' answers, and the second with the answers from the student.</li>
<li>A correct (matching) answer awards 4 points.</li>
<li>An incorrect answer is -1</li>
<li>A blank answer awards no points.</li>
<li>If score < 0, return 0.</li>
</ul>
